# NY-Solar-Readiness

Data visualization of New York's Solar Ready Projects

New York's Local Law 24 requires The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to assess all City-owned buildings for solarreadiness, which is defined as a building that is 10,000 or more gross building square feet, has a roof that is less than or equal to 10 years old or newer, and is in good structural condition. 

This project visualizes solar roof projects that are In-Progress or Completed using Python and Jupyter notebooks.
